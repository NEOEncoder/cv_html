    <p>
         Along with being a Professional IT Manager, I am a professional degree holder of Masters in English Literature & Linguistics. <br>
         I have extensively dived into the technical field of IT & Web Development enhance my skills and further explore opportunities <br>
         My perspective about skill based knowledge is more diverse and it expands to the level where I believe that any practical knowledge <br>
        is far above anything that is only based on myths & theories.</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I like learning new skill sets in this digital field. Besides, I spend my time exploring e-media and work on my marketing skills. <br>
        To freshen up my mind, I like to spend some time with my friends playing latest multiplayer video games every day so I can code <br>
        better. Moreover, I am a keen lover of travelling since I like to drive across the coastal areas and the northern regions of the <br>
        countryside. I like engaging with new people to study about the human nature and behavior of general public. This healthy excercise <br>
        helps me in evolving my personality since I believe that every individual has his/her special aura and they teach you something in life.</p>
